# THOUGHT PROCESS
This is a project done for my self study course, in which I decided to learn Python. We have to do 4 milestones, and originally I was going to start on the graphical stuff with milestone 3, but there's so much and I'm so interested in it that I decided to fast track this to milestone 2! My original milestone 4 is now the new milestone 3, and now I have an even bigger, better milestone 4 that I've been working on and am really proud of so far. So, for this one, I've decided to make snake (with my own touches, of course) using one of many Python graphical libraries, turtle. I'll be using other graphical libraries for my other milestones, as I really want to expand my skills and checking out a bunch of different libraries is a fun way to do that.
